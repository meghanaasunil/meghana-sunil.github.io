      <p>Hello I'm Meghana Sunil!! </p>
      <p>I'm a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science) student at VIT Chennai, working under the guidance of <a href="#">Dr. Joe Dhanith</a> on machine learning, domain generalization, and multimodal representation learning. I've gained experience as a Machine Learning Research Intern at the Center for Neuroinformatics, as a Software Development Engineer and Computer Vision Engineer with SpoRIC, and as a Machine Learning Intern at MulticoreWare Inc., where I worked on optimized CNNs, quantized deep learning models, and deployment-ready transformer pipelines.</p>
      <p>Outside academics, I'm deeply involved in cultural and creative work on campus. I lead major cultural events and serve as President of the university's dance club, where I choreograph, perform, and build spaces for artistic expression.</p>
